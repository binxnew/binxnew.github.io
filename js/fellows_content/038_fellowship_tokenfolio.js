      project_description:
            "Traditional Decentralized exchanges only let you swap one coin for another and it is hard to see everything in your wallet all at once and how it relates to your overall portfolio. They can also be confusing and overly complicated for many people. Also, if you want to balance your portfolio to certain percentages you had to do manual trades and math. Ain't nobody got time for that! To solve this problem Tokenfolio was born.",
