      project_description:
            "Currently in Bitcoin, when a payment is made it is also received. This means that the transaction size is a function of the number of inputs spent and the number of users receiving. For a large business trying to make a large number of payments, this either means paying very high fees or having transactions get stuck confirming.  With OP_SECURETHEBAG, we separate out the concern of receiving and spending. Essentially, OP_SECURETHEBAG allows a payer to issue an unlimited number of Certified Checks (like the kind you get from the bank) which are fully and provably collateralized in a single UTXO. At any time later, these certified checks can be redeemed into outputs. This leads to better utilization of blockspace, a healthier backlog of transactions, and less time waiting for confirmations for users.",

                  "Jeremy Rubin has been living and breathing Bitcoin since he was in high school in 2011. While in college, Jeremy co-founded the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and Scaling Bitcoin organization. After completing his Bachelors and Masters at MIT in 2016, Jeremy set his sights on Bitcoin research and development. Jeremy's current focus is on layer one transaction scalability, through the OP_SECURETHEBAG proposal, which will allow an unlimited number of payments to confirm per block. He's also served as a technical advisor to several projects, including Layer One and Stellar. Jeremy also has a predilection for provoking legal threats (and winning his cases).  In 2013, his web-mining project Tidbit drew the ire of the Attorney General of New Jersey.  Also, in 2017, his project Fuck Nazis Virtual Lapel Pin was censored by the US Government.",
