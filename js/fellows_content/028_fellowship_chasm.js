            "CHASM (Cryptoassets Health Analytics and Social Metrics) is a project focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health of crypto assets. It would allow founders and investors to understand interactivity between project life-cycle factors such as developer and customer activity.  Taking inspiration from Linux Foundationâ€™s metrics community we are developing metrics, and methodologies for expressing crypto project health and sustainability. By measuring project health and sustainability, we aim to improve the transparency and actionability of project health and sustainability so that contributors and investors can make more informed decisions about Cryptoassets.",
