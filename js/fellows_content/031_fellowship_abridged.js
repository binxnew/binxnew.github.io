            "Abridged enables developers to seamlessly integrate Web 3 features that abstract blockchain technicalities for their users without compromising the core value of their app. Our suite of developer tools gives developers the ability to modularly extend their app’s Web 3 functionality, regardless of their blockchain experience level. Our SDK and CLI not only allow for seasoned blockchain developers to add components like account contracts and layer 2 solutions, but also serves as an onramp for Web 2 developers interested in building with Web 3 technology.",

                  "James Young considers himself an operator. On the founding team at SpankChain, James helped lead engineering to implement the first true live layer 2 dApp. He started to think about Abridged while developing Spankchain, honing the experience and solving the many research problems that implementing Layer2 production-ready apps require. James also worked on Moloch and implementing its contracts. He co-authored the adChain whitepaper, which is recognized as the model that pioneered the idea for token curated registries and other crypto-economic primitives. James was an early employee of InterVu - later acquired by Akamai, was the chief architect at Click.tv - successfully acquired by Cisco. James also has a background in gaming, helped launch FarmVille - and co-founded mobile gaming studio Playviews.",

                  "Eric discovered Ethereum in 2016 and learned how to write smart contracts in early 2017. He’s pushed technical blockchain education through the formal academic route as adjunct faculty at USC and the alternative coding boot camp route as the founder of DApperNetwork. He firmly believes that the decentralization of features should be positively correlated to a user’s comfort with web 3.  He is working to make this design pattern applicable by any developer for their dapp through his current startup, Abridged. He’s frequently organized developer meetups, conferences, and hack nights for the LA community.",

                  "Intrigued by the idea of a zero marginal cost society and the potential for blockchain networks to create societal efficiencies, James Duncan began educating himself on the ecosystem in early 2017. While working with the Ethereum Foundation in 2018, he developed an appreciation for the challenges involved in advancing the Ethereum network. Post EF, James surrounded himself in conversations focused on finding a sustainable funding mechanism for open source projects.  With an eclectic background in geology and renewable energy tech, James brings to the table an ability to understand the needs of complex industries and coordinating projects.",
