            "Buidler is the first task runner for Ethereum smart contract developers. It unlocks productivity through flexibility, interoperability, and standardization.  With Buidler developers can compile, test and deploy their code, as well as very quickly write ad-hoc tools to facilitate working with their smart contracts. Pulling data, triggering actions and changing state all require little work with Buidler when compared to doing it from scratch, using just an Ethereum library. Most of the boilerplate stuff is taken care of so the user can focus on the functionality.",
