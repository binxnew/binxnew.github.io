            "Ironbelly was our very first awarded Fellowship project.  It is a mobile Grin wallet that is open-source, free to use, and focused on making it easy and delightful to use Grin on your phone.  Grin is a community-driven implementation of MimbleWimble, which itself is a privacy coin concept described first in a whitepaper published anonymously in July 2016 by someone using the name of Tom Elvis Jedusor, a Harry Potter character. MimbleWimble details the concept of a privacy coin using the Confidential Transactions construction by Greg Maxwell. The Grin developer community is made up of hardcore developers who are contributing out of pure passion as they don’t benefit from a pre-mine. They move fast and shipped a mainnet faster than most commercial projects out there, mostly working part-time. ",
