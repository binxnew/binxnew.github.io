            "GoBNB is a smartphone app that uses Binance Chain (Binance DEX) to allow participating retailers to accept crypto currency payments in BNB and other supported BEP-2 tokens. GoBNB will integrate with major POS providers to fetch item and menu data automatically, that will allow a user to simply scan an itemâ€™s QR code to add the item in her cart that can be later paid for by the supported tokens. Users can also use the app to pay each other in a decentralized manner. Check out the source code for GoBNB here: https://github.com/gobnb",
