      project_description:
            "Blockchain has enabled decentralized value transfer. A bigger future is decentralized communication. One step forward is anonymous decentralized communication which provides a censorship resistance privacy preserved communication network that one can send/receive, broadcast messages anonymously without revealing message metadata(sender, receiver, who send to whom, etc). It will find broad use cases, e.g., transaction and validator privacy in blockchain(Eth 2.0, Cosmos etc), whistleblowing, anonymous group channel/chat, anonymous survey, privacy preserved message broadcasting in Dapps etc. Anonymity is achieved by implementing Dandelion++ protocol on top of libp2p, Dandelion++ is a messaging routing protocol that protects against deanonymization attacks. Libp2p is a full stack modular framework for building scalable peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the network can communicate using a pattern known as Publish-Subscribe (PubSub), this pattern will be used for message(text, transactions, blocks, votes etc.) broadcasting. Messages can be encrypted by Libp2pâ€™s TLS transport(eventually Noise protocol) to provide further privacy.",
