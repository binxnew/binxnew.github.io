      project_description:
            "TradeScope will study both misleading cryptocurrency trading practices, and market manipulation that exploits technical details and glitches in the operation of the exchanges. Such techniques are used by predatory traders with deep knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and the exchangeâ€™s microstructure to gain an unfair advantage over the other market participants. The goal is to shed light on these, often poorly understood, predatory techniques and propose novel mitigation and detection methods. For this purpose, TradeScope will conduct a large-scale study on manipulation in cryptocurrency exchanges. This will enable us to better understand the technical underpinnings of common fairness problems in cryptocurrency exchanges and propose market design improvements that effectively thwart manipulation without affecting price discovery. Overall, we anticipate that our findings will be relevant to exchanges worldwide and more importantly to cryptocurrency exchanges.",
