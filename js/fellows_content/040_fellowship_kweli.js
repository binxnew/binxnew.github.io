            "Kweli provides a protocol to enable businesses comply with legal requirements to facilitate smooth transacting within member states of the African Union. Kweli consists of a screening process to establish whether an entrepreneur can run a business in an AU member state. The second part of Kweli is a decentralized registry of requisite documents (business registration schemas, licenses schemas and regulatory permit schemas) in W3C Verifiable Credentials format. <p>  The core instance of Kweli is an exchange for verifiable credentials required by the AU Movement Protocol. Kweli will provide a public registry that will define schemas for credentials issued by the African Union Trade Council to organizations and companies in member states to be used for transactions within signatories of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). Kweliâ€™s registry shall be served on a platform which creates a network of verifiable organizations enabling trusted business transactions and supporting trade between parties in different jurisdictions in the AfCFTA block.",
