      project_description:
            "Cambrian Research builds a scientific approach to DeFi design through understanding incentives and dynamics in stablecoin systems. DeFi is a frontier of financial design, in which designs are currently ad hoc and the set of tools for understanding these systems is extremely limited. Yet, the underlying blockchain setting suggests that new mechanisms are possible for solving previously insurmountable incentive problems. Cambrian Research aims to bridge the gap in security guarantees from incentive alignment. Stablecoins create an emergent economic system between many agents and contracts. The study of incentive alignment seeks to verify whether these systems behave as intended (e.g., to be stable), and which settings and designs can achieve this. Toward this, Cambrian Research develops models of dynamics in noncustodial stablecoins, which will enable a market design approach to optimizing stablecoin designs. These models explore deleveraging spirals that lead to faster rates of collateral drawdown and perverse incentives that can lead to economic attacks. Modeling noncustodial stablecoins is complicated because stablecoin 'market makers' are profit-maximizing leveraged speculators who are not committed to stability. Further, truly 'stable' assets are typically not efficiently accessible--the goal of a stablecoin is to create such a 'stable' asset in the first place. This means that payouts/liquidations are subject to significant market risks and maintaining a 'stable' position requires re-buying into the stablecoin, causing endogenous price effects. Stablecoins additionally face risks of price oracle manipulation, which plays another crucial role in the design.",

                  "Ariah's work with Cambrian Research builds a scientific approach to DeFi design through understanding incentives and dynamics in stablecoin systems. He developed the first model of non-custodial stablecoins, which is a foundation in this approach. This work addresses the gap in security guarantees from incentive alignment. Stablecoins create an emergent economic system between many agents and contracts. The study of incentive alignment seeks to verify whether these systems behave as intended (e.g., to be stable), and which settings and designs can achieve this. Ariah is also an applied math PhD candidate at Cornell, where his work is at the intersection of computer science and economics studying complex financial networks. His PhD work is supported by a Bloomberg Fellowship. Ariah previously worked in the finance technology sector, where he developed fixed income risk models and economic classification tools. He also pioneered the economic network model for risk-clustering at Locus Analytics.",
