He received his training as a communications engineer in the United States Marine Corps where he and his unit were responsible for building and maintaining the communications and Internet infrastructure for Iraq's Al Anbar Province during Operation Iraqi Freedom 07-08. These efforts included the engineering of field data centers, satellite communications, and the implementation and management of mission-critical cryptographic assets. After retiring from the Marine Corps, Zak worked in the field of cyber security, network engineering, and applied cryptography. He also ran an Internet agency and worked with Google prior to founding Whiteblock, a blockchain testing company whose clientele includes the Department of Defense, ConsenSys, Beam, RChain, Syscoin, and the Ethereum Foundation.",

                  "John is a 20 year veteran of the software development industry. His first job was programming a handheld voice recognition device in 16 bit x86 Assembly back in 1998. However, it wasn't long before the dotcom boom swept him into web development where he eventually worked at places like Geni, WeedMaps, and ZipRecruiter. His interest in cryptocurrencies started when he became aware of MtGox.  He wrote a Perl library and utilities for their REST API so he could buy and sell Bitcoin from the comfort of his command line. Unfortunately, MtGox's demise scared him away from cryptocurrencies and trading until 2016 when he reentered the market as a long-term investor. That was fine until the bear market of 2018 hit. The desire to understand why the market moved the way it did lead to his newfound interest in technical analysis and trading.",
