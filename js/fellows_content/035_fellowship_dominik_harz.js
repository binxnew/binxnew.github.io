      project_description:
            "Decentralized stablecoins backed by cryptocurrency assts face two problems: (1) backing cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and, thus, agents need to over-collateralize their assets to account for fluctuations. In practice, this is somewhat unpredictable, and hence, the amount of collateral is often much higher than required by the system. For example, in Dai the liquidation threshold is at around 150%, whereas most CDPs provide around 400 to 600% collateral. (2) speculators have an interest to earn currency and their incentives are not necessarily aligned with keeping the coin stable.  To tackle both problems, we are researching a solution that builds on the existing Balance paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/675.pdf). We want to provide an incentive to speculators to stabilize a coin and offer a reduction of collateral as a reward. The idea of the protocol is to maintain the same level of security against economically rational speculators as before, but solve both aforementioned problems with a single mechanism. The project includes development of a game theoretic model,  incentive compatibility proofs, and a proof-of-concept implementation.",

                  "Dominik is a Ph.D. student and research assistant at the Imperial College London Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering. His research interests cover the design of crypto-economic protocols with a focus on incentives and efficiency of collateral. Dominik is also working on smart contracts as well as verifiable computation. He has further collaborated on XCLAIM, the first protocol for cross-chain interoperability of general blockchains accepted at a top-tier conference. In order to connect research with the latest innovations, he leads the Outlier Ventures research programme on convergence at Imperial. The programme allows students to work together with the leader in the decentralized space to combine distributed ledger technology with topics such as machine learning, cryptography, and game theory. Before joining Imperial, Dominik completed his MSc in distributed systems at TU Delft and KTH Stockholm. Previously, Dominik worked three years as a consultant for cybersecurity at PwC Germany.",
