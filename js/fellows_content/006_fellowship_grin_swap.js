      project_description:
            "GrinSwap originally started as a Proof of Concept of an atomic swap between the Grin testnet and Ethereum, in September of 2018. This was done to show that it is possible to do cross-chain swaps with Grin. This was later extended to Grin-Bitcoin and presented at Grincon0 in Berlin. The main use cases for GrinSwap are privacy and autonomy: It makes it easy for anyone to trade in and out of Grin trustlessly and without the need for a centralized trusted third party. GrinSwap makes OTC deals a breeze and introduces a privacy preserving method for buying and selling Grin. You donâ€™t have to surrender custody of your funds, and instead remain in full control, even while trading. It fits well in the spirit of Grin: it allows two parties to transact trustlessly without anyone else but the parties themselves knowing about this.",
