            "HOPR is an incentivized, decentralized mixnet scheme. Using Chaumian 'onion' encryption, HOPR protects both the encrypted message as well as the metadata associated with the message, such as sender/receiver info, the size of the message, the IP address being used, etc. In addition, HOPR believes that mass adoption and scale of a decentralized solution and privacy-preserving infrastructure need economic incentives. Therefore, the relayers in HOPR are compensated with a built-in incentivized mechanism. ",
