      project_description:
            "Wallet713 was the first third-party wallet for Grin, and came about to make general storing, sending, receiving more easy and usable, and over time to enable more advanced use cases. They’ve focused on laying the foundations for basic infrastructure at this early stage in Grin’s lifecycle. The wallet pioneered grinbox support, invoicing, and transaction proofs, all of which they saw a need in the community. Over time, they’ll be integrating more functionality in the wallet like cross-chain atomic swaps, to give users better privacy and better control of their assets.
