      project_description:
            "The Commons Stack is a modular ‘tech stack for the commons’ that enables communities to bootstrap themselves to achieve their goals by acting as enhanced platform cooperatives; allowing them to co-own and co-manage shared funds, while facilitating transparent collective decision making. It is being designed with a modular ‘viable systems approach’ to be more robust, unlike most other projects in the blockchain space. The funding from the Binance fellowship will be used to produce a proof-of-concept demo of the holistic Commons Stack system, modeled and simulated in cadCAD, with a front end web app for the benefit of our audience.  This demo will put a facsimile of the Commons Stack in the hands of future users and allow us to demonstrate the paradigm-changing impact of this technology.",
