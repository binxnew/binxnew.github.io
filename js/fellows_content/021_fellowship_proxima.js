      project_description:
            "Our goal is to decentralize the ability to provide data, interact with data to empower DApp developers, provide tools that speed up the creation of DApps, and drive adoption of blockchain technology. Our solution is general enough to enable our decentralized data providers to provide data for DApps for several blockchains / smart contract platforms while basing our security on the consensus of the blockchain that the data is coming from.  Our first step is to create this system for Binance Chain, where we will create a toolkit explorer that developers & wallets will use to interact with the Binance Chain, with a specific emphasis on performance. Along with providing an open-sourced explorer, we want to look at the immediate value that can be brought to wallets and DApps to promote the integration of our toolset and the Binance Chain DEX.",
