      project_description:
            "The project is a reinforcement learning based agent simulation, for simulating agents’ trade behavior in an exchange. Simulation settings will include agents, transaction fee mechanism, learning algorithms and simulation environment. Once the MVP(Minimum Viable Product) is created, various transaction fee mechanisms will be implemented for different simulation results. Agents’ trading behavior will vary according to the controlled transaction fee mechanism, and the simulation will be created so that the agents’ behavior will impact the transaction fee mechanism itself. Thus, creating a loop of agents’ behavior being impacted by their own actions.",

CASTO uses webRTC to dramatically reduce the cost of video streaming markets by using distributed p2p network technology, libp2p. He also developed the application that reduced 95% of the costs while achieving a 0% failure rate through server-side optimization by using Google Firestore, github static web hosting, and Netlify Edge. Jaeho is the Korean community organizer for Meteor, a full-stack reactive platform.",

His simulation mechanisms include data curation reward, auction for mass purchase in e-commerce, deep-learning validation, etc.  He is also developing an Application Performance Management (APM) tool for analyzing and visualizing logs created by nodes on the blockchain. APM tool tracks and analyzes the blockchain nodes’ CPU, RAM, transaction data, etc., and provides detection of any problems regarding computing resource loads.",
