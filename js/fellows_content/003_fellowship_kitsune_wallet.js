      project_description:
            "Kitsune wallet is the new name of Universally Upgradable Identity Proxy, which won our hackathon bounty in EthParis 2019. Similarly to the nine-tailed mythical shape-shifting fox, Kitsune wallet is a smart contract based account that will hold your crypto assets in a single contract (address) while being able to change appearance depending on your need. This change of appearance includes modifying the security logic of one’s account, adding interfaces (such as ERC1271) but also taking the appearance of common multisigs such as UniversalLogin’s ERC1077.",
