            "Summa provides cross-chain interoperability tools and services that enable projects, dApps, and even entire chains to transact in a single shared market and communicate effectively across chains. Our clients gain the ability to utilize the unique features of each blockchain, access cross-chain liquidity, mitigate risk more effectively, and reach new customer bases that would otherwise be inaccessible across chains. Leveraging combinations of cross-chain communication tools, including methodologies that we invented, we deliver custom tailored integrations that are fast, secure, and extremely flexible.",
